These are example and helper files for the AFL_PYTHON_MODULE feature.
See docs/python_mutators.txt for more information

Note that if you compile with python3.7 you must use python3 scripts, and if
you use pyton2.7 to compile python2 scripts!


example.py	- this is the template you can use, the functions are there
		  but they are empty

simple-chunk-replace.py - this is a simple example where chunks are replaced

common.py 	- this can be used for common functions and helpers.
		  the examples do not use this though. But you can :)

wrapper_afl_min.py - mutation of XML documents, loads XmlMutatorMin.py

XmlMutatorMin.py - module for XML mutation
