# Branches

The following branches exist:

* [release](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus/tree/release): the latest release
* [stable/trunk](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus/): stable state of AFL++ - it is synced from dev from time to time when we are satisfied with its stability
* [dev](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus/tree/dev): development state of AFL++ - bleeding edge and you might catch a checkout which does not compile or has a bug. *We only accept PRs in dev!!*
* (any other): experimental branches to work on specific features or testing new functionality or changes.

For releases, please see the [Releases](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus/releases) tab. Also take a look at the list of [major behaviour changes in AFL++](docs/behaviour_changes.md).
