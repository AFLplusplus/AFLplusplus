If you do not want to follow a tutorial but rather try an exercise type of
training, then we can highly recommend the following:

If you are interested in fuzzing structured data (where you define what the
structure is), these links have you covered:

* Superion for AFL++:

* libprotobuf for AFL++:
  [https://github.com/P1umer/AFLplusplus-protobuf-mutator](https://github.com/P1umer/AFLplusplus-protobuf-mutator)
* libprotobuf raw:
