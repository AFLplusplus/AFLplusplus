# QEMU AddressSanitizer Runtime

This library is the injected runtime used by QEMU AddressSanitizer (QASan).

The original repository is [here](https://github.com/andreafioraldi/qasan).

The version embedded in qemuafl is an updated version of just the usermode part
and this runtime is injected via LD_PRELOAD (so works just for dynamically
linked binaries).

The usage is super simple, just set the env var `AFL_USE_QASAN=1` when fuzzing
in qemu mode (-Q). afl-fuzz will automatically set AFL_PRELOAD to load this
library and enable the QASan instrumentation in afl-qemu-trace.

For debugging purposes, we still suggest to run the original QASan as the
stacktrace support for ARM (just a debug feature, it does not affect the bug
finding capabilities during fuzzing) is WIP.

### When should I use QASan?

If your target binary is PIC x86_64, you should also give a try to
[RetroWrite](https://github.com/HexHive/retrowrite) for static rewriting.

If it fails, or if your binary is for another architecture, or you want to use
persistent and snapshot mode, AFL++ QASan mode is what you want/have to use.

Note that the overhead of libdislocator when combined with QEMU mode is much
lower but it can catch less bugs. This is a short blanket, take your choice.
