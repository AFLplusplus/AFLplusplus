# GramaTron

Gramatron is a coverage-guided fuzzer that uses grammar automatons to perform
grammar-aware fuzzing.  Technical details about our framework are available
in the [ISSTA'21 paper](https://nebelwelt.net/files/21ISSTA.pdf).
The artifact to reproduce the experiments presented in the paper are present
in `artifact/`. Instructions to run a sample campaign and incorporate new
grammars is presented below: 

# Compiling

Simply execute `./build_gramatron_mutator.sh`

# Running

You have to set the grammar file to use with `GRAMMATRON_AUTOMATION`:

```
export AFL_DISABLE_TRIM=1
export AFL_CUSTOM_MUTATOR_ONLY=1
export AFL_CUSTOM_MUTATOR_LIBRARY=./gramatron.so
export GRAMATRON_AUTOMATION=grammars/ruby/source_automata.json
afl-fuzz -i in -o out -- ./target
```

# Adding and testing a new grammar

- Specify in a JSON format for CFG. Examples are correspond `source.json` files 
- Run the automaton generation script (in `src/gramfuzz-mutator/preprocess`)
  which will place the generated automaton in the same folder.
```
./preprocess/prep_automaton.sh <grammar_file> <start_symbol> [stack_limit]

Eg. ./preprocess/prep_automaton.sh ~/grammars/ruby/source.json PROGRAM
```
- If the grammar has no self-embedding rules then you do not need to pass the
  stack limit parameter. However, if it does have self-embedding rules then you
  need to pass the stack limit parameter. We recommend starting with `5` and
  then increasing it if you need more complexity
- To sanity-check that the automaton is generating inputs as expected you can use the `test` binary housed in `src/gramfuzz-mutator`
```
./test SanityCheck <automaton_file>

Eg. ./test SanityCheck ~/grammars/ruby/source_automata.json
```
