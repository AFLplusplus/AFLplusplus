# InsTrim
InsTrim: Lightweight Instrumentation for Coverage-guided Fuzzing


## Introduction

InsTrim uses CFG and markers to instrument just what is necessary in the
binary in llvm_mode. It is about 20-25% faster but as a cost has a lower
path discovery.


## Usage

Set the environment variable AFL_LLVM_INSTRIM=1

There is also an advanced mode which instruments loops in a way so that
afl-fuzz can see which loop path has been selected but not being able to
see how often the loop has been rerun.
This again is a tradeoff for speed for less path information.
To enable this mode set AFL_LLVM_INSTRIM_LOOPHEAD=1
