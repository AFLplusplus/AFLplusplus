# laf-intel instrumentation

## Introduction

This originally is the work of an individual nicknamed laf-intel.
His blog [Circumventing Fuzzing Roadblocks with Compiler Transformations]
(https://lafintel.wordpress.com/) and gitlab repo [laf-llvm-pass]
(https://gitlab.com/laf-intel/laf-llvm-pass/)
describe some code transformations that
help AFL++ to enter conditional blocks, where conditions consist of
comparisons of large values.

## Usage

By default these passes will not run when you compile programs using 
afl-clang-fast. Hence, you can use AFL as usual.
To enable the passes you must set environment variables before you
compile the target project.

The following options exist:

`export AFL_LLVM_LAF_SPLIT_SWITCHES=1`

Enables the split-switches pass.

`export AFL_LLVM_LAF_TRANSFORM_COMPARES=1`

Enables the transform-compares pass (strcmp, memcmp, strncmp,
strcasecmp, strncasecmp).

`export AFL_LLVM_LAF_SPLIT_COMPARES=1`

Enables the split-compares pass.
By default it will 
1. simplify operators >= (and <=) into chains of > (<) and == comparisons
2. change signed integer comparisons to a chain of sign-only comparison
and unsigned integer comparisons
3. split all unsigned integer comparisons with bit widths of
64, 32 or 16 bits to chains of 8 bits comparisons.

You can change the behaviour of the last step by setting
`export AFL_LLVM_LAF_SPLIT_COMPARES_BITW=<bit_width>`, where 
bit_width may be 64, 32 or 16. For example, a bit_width of 16
would split larger comparisons down to 16 bit comparisons.

A new experimental feature is splitting floating point comparisons into a
series of sign, exponent and mantissa comparisons followed by splitting each
of them into 8 bit comparisons when necessary.
It is activated with the `AFL_LLVM_LAF_SPLIT_FLOATS` setting.
Please note that full IEEE 754 functionality is not preserved, that is
values of nan and infinity will probably behave differently.

Note that setting this automatically activates `AFL_LLVM_LAF_SPLIT_COMPARES`

You can also set `AFL_LLVM_LAF_ALL` and have all of the above enabled :-)
