# FRIDA MODE
The purpose of FRIDA mode is to provide an alternative binary only fuzzer for AFL
just like that provided by QEMU mode. The intention is to provide a very similar
user experience, right down to the options provided through environment variables.

Whilst AFLplusplus already has some support for running on FRIDA [here](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus/tree/stable/utils/afl_frida)
this requires the code to be fuzzed to be provided as a shared library, it
cannot be used to fuzz executables. Additionally, it requires the user to write
a small harness around their target code of interest, FRIDA mode instead takes a
different approach to avoid these limitations.

# Current Progress
As FRIDA mode is new, it is missing a lot of features. The design is such that it
should be possible to add these features in a similar manner to QEMU mode and
perhaps leverage some of its design and implementation.

# Compatibility
Currently FRIDA mode supports Linux and macOS targets on both x86/x64
architecture and aarch64. Later releases may add support for aarch32 and Windows
targets as well as embedded linux environments.

FRIDA has been used on various embedded targets using both uClibc and musl C
runtime libraries, so porting should be possible. However, the current build
system does not support cross compilation.

## Getting Started
To build everything run `make`.

Various tests can be found in subfolders within the `test/` directory. To use
these, first run `make` to build any dependencies. Then run `make qemu` or
`make frida` to run on either QEMU of FRIDA mode respectively.

## Usage
FRIDA mode requires some small modifications to `afl-fuzz` and similar tools
in AFLplusplus. The intention is that it behaves identically to QEMU, but uses
the 'O' switch rather than 'Q'. Whilst the options 'f', 'F', 's' or 'S' may have
made more sense for a mode powered by FRIDA Stalker, they were all taken, so
instead we use 'O' in hommage to the [author](https://github.com/oleavr) of
FRIDA.

Similarly, the intention is to mimic the use of environment variables used by
QEMU where possible (although replacing `s/QEMU/FRIDA/g`). Accodingly, the
following options are currently supported.

* `AFL_FRIDA_DEBUG_MAPS` - See `AFL_QEMU_DEBUG_MAPS`
* `AFL_FRIDA_EXCLUDE_RANGES` - See `AFL_QEMU_EXCLUDE_RANGES`
* `AFL_FRIDA_INST_RANGES` - See `AFL_QEMU_INST_RANGES`
* `AFL_FRIDA_PERSISTENT_ADDR` - See `AFL_QEMU_PERSISTENT_ADDR`
* `AFL_FRIDA_PERSISTENT_CNT` - See `AFL_QEMU_PERSISTENT_CNT`
* `AFL_FRIDA_PERSISTENT_HOOK` - See `AFL_QEMU_PERSISTENT_HOOK`


# Performance

Additionally, the intention is to be able to make a direct performance
comparison between the two approaches. Accordingly, FRIDA mode includes various
tests target based on the [libpng](https://libpng.sourceforge.io/) benchmark used by
[fuzzbench](https://google.github.io/fuzzbench/) and integrated with the
[StandaloneFuzzTargetMain](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/llvm/llvm-project/main/compiler-rt/lib/fuzzer/standalone/StandaloneFuzzTargetMain.c)
from the llvm project. These tests include basic fork-server support, persistent mode
and persistent mode with in-memory test-cases. These are built and linked without
any special modifications to suit FRIDA or QEMU. The test data provided with libpng
is used as the corpus.

The intention is to add support for FRIDA mode to the FuzzBench project and
perform a like-for-like comparison with QEMU mode to get an accurate
appreciation of its performance.

Whilst [afl_frida](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus/tree/stable/utils/afl_frida)
claims a 5-10x performance increase over QEMU, it has not been possible to
reproduce these claims. It is thought that `afl_frida` was running a test case
in persistent mode, whereas the qemu test it was compared against was not and
this may account for the differences since it isn't a like-for-like comparison.

# Design
FRIDA mode is supported by using `LD_PRELOAD` (`DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` on macOS)
to inject a shared library (`afl-frida-trace.so`) into the target. This shared
library is built using the [frida-gum](https://github.com/frida/frida-gum)
devkit from the [FRIDA](https://github.com/frida/frida) project. One of the
components of frida-gum is [Stalker](https://medium.com/@oleavr/anatomy-of-a-code-tracer-b081aadb0df8),
this allows the dynamic instrumentation of running code for AARCH32, AARCH64,
x86 and x64 architectures. Implementation details can be found
[here](https://frida.re/docs/stalker/).

Dynamic instrumentation is used to augment the target application with similar
coverage information to that inserted by `afl-gcc` or `afl-clang`. The shared
library is also linked to the `compiler-rt` component of AFLplusplus to feedback
this coverage information to AFL++ and also provide a fork server. It also makes
use of the FRIDA [prefetch](https://github.com/frida/frida-gum/blob/56dd9ba3ee9a5511b4b0c629394bf122775f1ab7/gum/gumstalker.h#L115)
support to feedback instrumented blocks from the child to the parent using a
shared memory region to avoid the need to regenerate instrumented blocks on each
fork.

Whilst FRIDA allows for a normal C function to be used to augment instrumented
code, FRIDA mode instead makes use of optimized assembly instead on AARCH64 and
x86/64 targets. By injecting these small snippets of assembly, we avoid having
to push and pop the full register context. Note that since this instrumentation
is used on every basic block to generate coverage, it has a large impact on
performance.

CompLog support also adds code to the assembly, however, at present this code
makes use of a basic C function and is yet to be optimized. Since not all
instances run CompLog mode and instrumentation of the binary is less frequent
(only on CMP, SUB and CALL instructions) performance is not quite so critical.

# Advanced configuration options
* `AFL_FRIDA_INST_NO_OPTIMIZE` - Don't use optimized inline assembly coverage
instrumentation (the default where available). Required to use
`AFL_FRIDA_INST_TRACE`.
* `AFL_FRIDA_INST_NO_PREFETCH` - Disable prefetching. By default the child will
report instrumented blocks back to the parent so that it can also instrument
them and they be inherited by the next child on fork.
* `AFL_FRIDA_INST_TRACE` - Generate some logging when running instrumented code.
Requires `AFL_FRIDA_INST_NO_OPTIMIZE`.

# TODO
The next features to be added are x86 support, integration with FuzzBench and
support for ASAN. The intention is to achieve feature parity with QEMU mode in
due course. Contributions are welcome, but please get in touch to ensure that
efforts are deconflicted.
