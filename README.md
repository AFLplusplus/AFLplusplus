<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AFLplusplus/Website/master/static/aflpp_bg.svg" alt="AFL++ logo" width="250" heigh="250">

Release version: [4.01c](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus/releases)

GitHub version: 4.02a

Repository:
[https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus)

AFL++ is maintained by:

* Marc "van Hauser" Heuse <mh@mh-sec.de>
* Heiko "hexcoder-" Eißfeldt <heiko.eissfeldt@hexco.de>
* Andrea Fioraldi <andreafioraldi@gmail.com>
* Dominik Maier <mail@dmnk.co>
* Documentation: Jana Aydinbas <jana.aydinbas@gmail.com>

Originally developed by Michał "lcamtuf" Zalewski.

AFL++ is a superior fork to Google's AFL - more speed, more and better
mutations, more and better instrumentation, custom module support, etc.

You are free to copy, modify, and distribute AFL++ with attribution under the
terms of the Apache-2.0 License. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.

## Getting started

Here is some information to get you started:

* For an overview of the AFL++ documentation and a very helpful graphical guide,
  please visit [docs/README.md](docs/README.md).
* To get you started with tutorials, go to
  [docs/tutorials.md](docs/tutorials.md).
* For releases, see the
  [Releases tab](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus/releases) and
  [branches](#branches). The best branches to use are, however, `stable` or
  `dev` - depending on your risk appetite. Also take a look at the list of
  [important changes in AFL++](docs/important_changes.md) and the list of
  [features](docs/features.md).
* If you want to use AFL++ for your academic work, check the
  [papers page](https://aflplus.plus/papers/) on the website.
* To cite our work, look at the [Cite](#cite) section.
* For comparisons, use the fuzzbench `aflplusplus` setup, or use
  `afl-clang-fast` with `AFL_LLVM_CMPLOG=1`. You can find the `aflplusplus`
  default configuration on Google's
  [fuzzbench](https://github.com/google/fuzzbench/tree/master/fuzzers/aflplusplus).

## Building and installing AFL++

To have AFL++ easily available with everything compiled, pull the image directly
from the Docker Hub (available for both x86_64 and arm64):

```shell
docker pull aflplusplus/aflplusplus
docker run -ti -v /location/of/your/target:/src aflplusplus/aflplusplus
```

This image is automatically published when a push to the stable branch happens
(see [branches](#branches)). If you use the command above, you will find your
target source code in `/src` in the container.

Note: you can also pull `aflplusplus/aflplusplus:dev` which is the most current
development state of AFL++.

To build AFL++ yourself - *which we recommend* - continue at
[docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md).

## Quick start: Fuzzing with AFL++

*NOTE: Before you start, please read about the
[common sense risks of fuzzing](docs/fuzzing_in_depth.md#0-common-sense-risks).*

This is a quick start for fuzzing targets with the source code available. To
read about the process in detail, see
[docs/fuzzing_in_depth.md](docs/fuzzing_in_depth.md).

To learn about fuzzing other targets, see:
* Binary-only targets:
  [docs/fuzzing_binary-only_targets.md](docs/fuzzing_binary-only_targets.md)
* Network services:
  [docs/best_practices.md#fuzzing-a-network-service](docs/best_practices.md#fuzzing-a-network-service)
* GUI programs:
  [docs/best_practices.md#fuzzing-a-gui-program](docs/best_practices.md#fuzzing-a-gui-program)

Step-by-step quick start:

1. Compile the program or library to be fuzzed using `afl-cc`. A common way to
   do this would be:

   ```
   CC=/path/to/afl-cc CXX=/path/to/afl-c++ ./configure --disable-shared
   make clean all
   ```

2. Get a small but valid input file that makes sense to the program. When
   fuzzing verbose syntax (SQL, HTTP, etc.), create a dictionary as described in
   [dictionaries/README.md](dictionaries/README.md), too.

3. If the program reads from stdin, run `afl-fuzz` like so:

   ```
   ./afl-fuzz -i seeds_dir -o output_dir -- \
   /path/to/tested/program [...program's cmdline...]
   ```

   To add a dictionary, add `-x /path/to/dictionary.txt` to afl-fuzz.

   If the program takes input from a file, you can put `@@` in the program's
   command line; AFL++ will put an auto-generated file name in there for you.

4. Investigate anything shown in red in the fuzzer UI by promptly consulting
   [docs/afl-fuzz_approach.md#understanding-the-status-screen](docs/afl-fuzz_approach.md#understanding-the-status-screen).

5. You will find found crashes and hangs in the subdirectories `crashes/` and
   `hangs/` in the `-o output_dir` directory. You can replay the crashes by
   feeding them to the target, e.g. if your target is using stdin:

   ```
   cat output_dir/crashes/id:000000,* | /path/to/tested/program [...program's cmdline...]
   ```

   You can generate cores or use gdb directly to follow up the crashes.

6. We cannot stress this enough - if you want to fuzz effectively, read the
   [docs/fuzzing_in_depth.md](docs/fuzzing_in_depth.md) document!

## Contact

Questions? Concerns? Bug reports?

* The contributors can be reached via (e.g., by creating an issue):
  [https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus).
* Take a look at our [FAQ](docs/FAQ.md). If you find an interesting or important
  question missing, submit it via
  [https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus/discussions](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus/discussions).
* Best: join the [Awesome Fuzzing](https://discord.gg/gCraWct) Discord server.
* There is a (not really used) mailing list for the AFL/AFL++ project
  ([browse archive](https://groups.google.com/group/afl-users)). To compare
  notes with other users or to get notified about major new features, send an
  email to <afl-users+subscribe@googlegroups.com>, but note that this is not
  managed by us.

## Branches

The following branches exist:

* [release](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus/tree/release): the latest
  release
* [stable/trunk](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus/): stable state of
  AFL++ - it is synced from dev from time to time when we are satisfied with its
  stability
* [dev](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus/tree/dev): development state
  of AFL++ - bleeding edge and you might catch a checkout which does not compile
  or has a bug. **We only accept PRs (pull requests) for the 'dev' branch!**
* (any other): experimental branches to work on specific features or testing new
  functionality or changes.

## Help wanted

We have several [ideas](docs/ideas.md) we would like to see in AFL++ to make it
even better. However, we already work on so many things that we do not have the
time for all the big ideas.

This can be your way to support and contribute to AFL++ - extend it to do
something cool.

For everyone who wants to contribute (and send pull requests), please read our
[contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before you submit.

## Special thanks

Many of the improvements to the original AFL and AFL++ wouldn't be possible
without feedback, bug reports, or patches from our contributors.

Thank you! (For people sending pull requests - please add yourself to this list
:-)
