# To make this script work:
#
# - Edit FUZZ_HOSTS, FUZZ_DOMAIN, FUZZ_USER, and SYNC_DIR to reflect your
#   environment.
#
# - Make sure that the system you are running this on can log into FUZZ_HOSTS
#   without a password (authorized_keys or otherwise).
#
# - Make sure that every fuzzer is running with -o pointing to SYNC_DIR and -S
#   that consists of its local host name, followed by an underscore, and then
#   by some host-local fuzzer ID.
#

# Hosts to synchronize the data across.
FUZZ_HOSTS='host1 host2 host3 host4'

# Domain for all hosts
FUZZ_DOMAIN='example.com'

# Remote user for SSH
FUZZ_USER=bob

# Directory to synchronize
SYNC_DIR='/home/bob/sync_dir'

# Interval (seconds) between sync attempts
SYNC_INTERVAL=$((30 * 60))
