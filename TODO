Roadmap 2.53d:
==============
 - indent all the code: .clang-format

 - update docs/sister_projects.txt

afl-fuzz:
 - put mutator, scheduler, forkserver and input channels in individual files
 - reuse forkserver for showmap, afl-cmin, etc.

gcc_plugin:
 - needs to be rewritten
 - fix crashes when compiling :(
 - whitelist support
 - skip over uninteresting blocks
 - laf-intel
 - neverZero

qemu_mode:
 - deferred mode with AFL_DEFERRED_QEMU=0xaddress
   @andrea - dont we have that already with AFL_ENTRYPOINT?

unit testing / or large testcase campaign


Roadmap 2.54d:
==============
Problem: Average targets (tiff, jpeg, unrar) go through 1500 edges.
         At afl's default map that means ~16 collisions and ~3 wrappings.
  Solution #1: increase map size.
    every +1 decreases fuzzing speed by ~10% and halfs the collisions
    birthday paradox predicts at collisions at this # of edges:
	2^16 = 302
	2^17 = 427
	2^18 = 603
	2^19 = 853
	2^20 = 1207
	2^21 = 1706
	2^22 = 2412
	2^23 = 3411
	2^24 = 4823
    Its an easy solution but also not a good one.
  Solution #2: use dynamic map size and collision free basic block IDs
    This only works in llvm_mode and llvm >= 9 though
    A potential good future solution
  Solution #3: write instruction pointers to a big shared map
    512kb/1MB shared map and the instrumented code writes the instruction
    pointer into the map. Map must be big enough but could be command line
    controlled.
    Good: complete coverage information, nothing is lost. choice of analysis
          impacts speed, but this can be decided by user options
    Neutral: a little bit slower but no loss of coverage
    Bad: completely changes how afl uses the map and the scheduling.
    Overall another very good solution
    
qemu_mode:
 - persistent mode patching the return address (WinAFL style)
 - instrument only comparison with immediate values by default when using compcov
