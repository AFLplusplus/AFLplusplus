# TODO list for AFL++

## Roadmap 3.00+

 - align map to 64 bytes but keep real IDs
 - Update afl->pending_not_fuzzed for MOpt
 - put fuzz target in top line of UI
 - afl-plot to support multiple plot_data
 - afl_custom_fuzz_splice_optin()
 - afl_custom_splice()
 - better autodetection of shifting runtime timeout values
 - cmplog: use colorization input for havoc?
 - parallel builds for source-only targets


## Further down the road

afl-fuzz:
 - setting min_len/max_len/start_offset/end_offset limits for mutation output

qemu_mode:
 - non colliding instrumentation
 - rename qemu specific envs to AFL_QEMU (AFL_ENTRYPOINT, AFL_CODE_START/END,
   AFL_COMPCOV_LEVEL?)
 - add AFL_QEMU_EXITPOINT (maybe multiple?), maybe pointless as we have
   persistent mode
 - add/implement AFL_QEMU_INST_LIBLIST and AFL_QEMU_NOINST_PROGRAM
 - add/implement AFL_QEMU_INST_REGIONS as a list of _START/_END addresses


## Ideas

 - LTO/sancov: write current edge to prev_loc and use that information when
   using cmplog or __sanitizer_cov_trace_cmp*. maybe we can deduct by follow
   up edge numbers that both following cmp paths have been found and then
   disable working on this edge id -> cmplog_intelligence branch
 - use cmplog colorization taint result for havoc locations?
 - new instrumentation option for a thread-safe variant of feedback to shared mem.
   The user decides, if this is needed (eg the target is multithreaded).
